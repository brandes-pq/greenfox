Our first Greenfox schema. It VISITs a single resource - the airports index
folder, and it CHECKs its contents, using a FolderContent constraint. 

The constraint is represented by a <folderContent> element, with child
elements describing the folder members. Member names may use wildcards. 
Default cardinality is 1..1. Use @minCount, @maxCount or @count to 
specify other constraints. If @closed is used, the folder must not 
contain members which do not match any of name attributes.
    
Launch validation with a command like this:
   gfox /path/to/air01.xml
   
Use different options for changing the report type, e.g.:
   gfox -r /path/to/air01.xml
   
Report type options:   
-a   summary report, only constraint statistics
-b   as before, but red resources are listed (default)
-c   as before, but also green resources are listed
-r   list for all red resources all results
-w   list for all resources all results
