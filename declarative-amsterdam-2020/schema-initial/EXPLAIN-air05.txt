Now we start to CONNECT THE RESOURCES: we add a constraint which looks not only
at the resource to be validated, but also a second resource and requires the
two to be somehow related. Most often, "looking at resources" means evaluating 
expressions in their context - one expression in the context of the first 
resource, another expression in the context of the other resource. And the 
relationship between the resources is observed by comparing the two values.
    
A VALUE COMPARED constraint is thus composed of 
    (a) a specification which resource(s) to use as the second resource
    (b) an expression to be evaluated in the context of the first resource 
    (c) an expression to be evaluated in the context of the second resource 
    (d) further attributes or child elements specifying what to expect from 
        the pair of expression values.
        
Here, we check that the @country value in the XML file is equal to the 
"country" in the accompanying JSON document. So the XML document is compared
with a JSON document, which is selected by the @foxpath expression on 
<valueCompared>. A Foxpath expression is only one of several ways how the 
partner resource can be selected.
    
Also note that the JSON document is parsed into an XML node tree and thus made 
accessible to XPath navigation. XPath everywhere!
