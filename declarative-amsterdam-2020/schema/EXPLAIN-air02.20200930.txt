We added the check of a file resource: we visit all FLAG files and check
their size, which must be 0.

In the <fileSize> element, you see a pair of attributes which is quite
typical: a constraint attribute (@eq), which declares a constraint; and
a message attribute with a name derived from the constraint attribute by
appending 'Msg'. As you might expect, the <fileSize> element can also
be used with other constraints expressing a comparison - @lt, @le, @gt, 
@le, @ne - and each one of them can be accompanied by a corresponding 
message attribute.

Such messages are added to the validation result in case of constraint
violation. You have not yet seen the results themselves. Please try out
the same call with option -w inserted before the schema name:

  gfox -w /path/to/greenfox/declarative-amsterdam-2020/schema/air02.gfox.xml 

For each validation, a result element is produced. The element name is
'green' or 'red'. Each element describes the checking of a single resource
against a single constraint. Such checking is the atom of the validation
process, and result elements are the atoms of a Greenfox validation report.

You may also define messages commenting on conformance: use attributes 
with names like @eqMsgOK, @ltMsgOK, @geMsgOK, etc. Let's try it out - 
add to the <fileSize> element an attribute similar to
 
  @eqMsgOK="OK - FLAG file empty." 

Repeat the call with -w, and, hopefully, you'll see your message.

Now let's provoke an error. We tweak the schema - replace eq="0"
with eq="1000". Repeat the call, now without -w:
    
  gfox /path/to/greenfox/declarative-amsterdam-2020/schema/air02.gfox.xml
      
The summary report now tells us about a violation - see the table
line with "FileSizeEq"; the name of the offending resource is displayed
below. If you call the validation with option -r, you see just the red
results:

  gfox -r /path/to/greenfox/declarative-amsterdam-2020/schema/air02.gfox.xml
