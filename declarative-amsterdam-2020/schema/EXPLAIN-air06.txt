We visit the JSON document and check that all href links can be resolved. But
what exactly is a "link"? Is there some hardcoded assumption that items named
"href" contain link URIs?

Certainly not. A link is a mapping of a resource to other resources, defined 
by a LINK DEFINITION. Greenfox includes an elaborate model of link definitions, 
which can use different forms. The most important difference between Greenfox
as of xmlprague and Greenfox of Amsterdam is the introduction of a Link model.

In this case the complete link definition is specified by the @hrefXP expression, 
interpreted as an XPath yielding the items containing link URIs. The @resolvable 
attribute is a constraint, meaning that any URI produced by the href expression 
must be successfully resolved to a target resource. And the 
@minCountTargetResources is another constraint - the number of link target 
resources must be > 0.

So a <links> constraint always has two parts: (1) a Link Definition and (2) 
constraints. The Link Definition maps the resource to other resources. The
constraints check the outcome against expectations. 

The Link Definition can take quite different forms.

The second <links> element uses a URI expression yielding the target URIs.

The third <links> element uses a Foxpath expression yielding the target
resources. It navigates the file system, rather than construct a URI.

The fourth <links> element also uses a Foxpath expression selecting a 
target resource, but then drills into the document and yields a node
found inside - note the @targetXP attribute. The link model of Greenfox
includes an optional target node selector, narrowing down the link
result to content nodes, rather than URI or root node.

The last <links> element uses a mirror - it selects a resource found
at the same position under reflector 2 as the current resource is found
at under reflector 1.
