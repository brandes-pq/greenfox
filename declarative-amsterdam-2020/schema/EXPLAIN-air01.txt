Our first Greenfox schema. It VISITs a single resource - the airports index
folder, and it CHECKs its contents, using a FolderContent constraint. 
    
Launch validation with a command like this:
   gfox /path/to/air01.xml
   
Use different options for changing the report type, e.g.:
   gfox -r /path/to/air01.xml
   
Report type options:   
-a   summary report, only constraint statistics
-b   as before, but red resources are listed (default)
-c   as before, but also green resources are listed
-r   list for all red resources all results
-w   list for all resources all results

You may want to experiment with the schema, slightly change the details -
e.g. changing file names or adding more <memberFile> elements.

Note ...
- the use of backslashes in file system navigation (also on Unix)
- the use of wildcards
- the use of explicit cardinality constraints (default: @count=1)
- the use of a @closed attribute - only the described members are allowed
