    Demonstrates the use of constraint component DocSimilar.
    
    Constraint components:
    * Name:  DocSimilar
    - XML:   docSimilar/(@otherFoxpath, skipItem*, roundItem*)
    - Check: The current file must be represented by a node tree which is equal to the 
             node tree(s) provided by the Foxpath expression (either as node trees or
             as URIs to be resolved), taking into consideration exceptions defined 
             by child elements <skipItem> and <roundItem>.
             
    * Name:  DocSimilarCount
    - XML:   docSimilar/@count
    - Check: The number of node trees with which to compare must be equal to the specified 
             value
             
    * Name:  DocSimilarMinCount
    - XML:   docSimilar/@minCount
    - Check: The number of node trees with which to compare must be greater than or equal to 
             the specified value
             
    * Name:  DocSimilarMaxCount
    - XML:   docSimilar/@maxCount
    - Check: The number of node trees with which to compare must be less than or equal to the 
             specified value

    When attributes @count, @minCount or @maxCount are used, they constrain the number
    of node trees with which to compare. By default, there must be exactly one node
    tree with which to compare.
    
    When comparing node trees, both trees are modified before comparing, as indicated by
    modifier elements, which are child elements of the <docSimilar> element:
    * <skipItem> elements identify items to be removed
    * <roundItem> elements identify items the text value of which is replaced with a rounded value
    
    Modifier elements identify the items to which they apply using selector attributes, all of
    which are optional:
    * item kind - @kind, 'element' or 'attribute'
    * local name - @localName
    * namespace - @namespace
    * parent local name - @parentLocalName
    * parent namespace - @parentNamespace
    
    In this example, validation catches an 'executionSummary1.xml' file ...
    * for which no sibling file 'executionSummary2.xml' can be found
    * which is not similar to a sibling file 'executionSummary2.xml', ignoring 'articleNumber' and 
     'timestamp' elements and @fileSize attributes on 'articleBook' elements.
