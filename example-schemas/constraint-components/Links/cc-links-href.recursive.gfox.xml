<!-- 
    Demonstrates the use of constraint components Link*, which are represented
    by a <links> element. This example highlights the use of the 'recursive'
    parameter - links are applied recursively. Here, target resources are not
    only the resources identified by @href attributes in the context document,
    but also all resources found by recursively following the @href links in
    the target resources, their targets, etc.
    
    A LinksResolvable constraint (@resolvable = true) is violated if any target 
    URIs cannot be resolved. 
    
    A Link*Count constraint (@count*, @minCount*, @maxCount*) checks the number of
    - target resources (* = TargetResources)
    - target docs (* = TargetDocs)    
    - target nodes (* = TargetNodes)
    - link context nodes (* = ContextNodes)
    Target resources, target docs and target nodes are counted per link context node.

    violated if any links selected by a given expression, applied recursively to the
    results of resolving, cannot be resolved.
