    Demonstrates the use of recursive link targets. This example checks resources contained by an archive file.
    
    A recursive link target is a target consisting of the resources found by resolving links 
    recursively The links are provided by an XPath expression. Here, the target declaration is:
       @recursiveLinkXPath="//@href"
       
    The <targetSize> constraint element may declare a special constraint, @targetLinkResolvable, 
    which requires all links found by the target declaration to be resolvable.
    
    Note that count-related constraints of the <targetSize> element (e.g. @count or @minCount)
    refer to the number of target resources found, not to the number of links attempted to resolve,
    which may be higher. Use @targetLinkResolvable to ensure all links could be resolved.
