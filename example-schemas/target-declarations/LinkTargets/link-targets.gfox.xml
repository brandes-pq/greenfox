<!-- 
    Demonstrates the use of link targets. A link target is a target consisting of the resources
    found by resolving links. The links are provided by an XPath expression. Here, the target 
    declaration is:
       @linkXPath="//@href"
       
    The <targetSize> constraint element may declare a special constraint, @targetLinkResolvable, 
    which requires all links found by the target declaration to be resolvable.
    
    Note that count-related constraints of the <targetSize> element (e.g. @count or @minCount)
    refer to the number of linnks obtained from the target declaration, not to the number of 
    resolved links.
