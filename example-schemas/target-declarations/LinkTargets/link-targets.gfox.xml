<!-- 
    Demonstrates the use of link targets. A link target is defined by a resource shape which
    defines or references a link definition. In this example, the link is defined by the
    <file> shape, rather than referenced.
       
    The <targetSize> constraint element may declare link-related constraints: 
    - @resolvable
    as well as the link-related cardinality constraints:
    - countContextNodes, minCount..., maxCount...
    - countTargetResources, minCount..., maxCount...
    - countTargetDocs, minCount..., maxCount...
    - countTargetNodes, minCount..., maxCount...
    
    - countTargetResourcesPerContextPoint, minCount..., maxCount...
    - countTargetDocsPerContextPoint, minCount..., maxCount...
    - countTargetNodesPerContextPoint, minCount..., maxCount...
    
    Note that the non-link-related cardinality constraints of the <targetSize> element (@count, 
    @minCount, @maxCount) are synonyms of (count|minCount|maxCount)TargetResources, or of
    (count|minCount|maxCount)TargetDocs.
