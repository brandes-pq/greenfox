<!-- 
    Demonstrates the use of link targets. A link target is defined by a resource shape which
    defines or references a link definition. In this example, the link is defined by the
    <file> shape, rather than referenced.
       
    The <targetSize> constraint element may declare link-related constraints: @resolvable,
    as well as the link-related cardinality constraints:
    - countContextNodes, minCount..., maxCount...
    - countTargetResources, minCount..., maxCount...
    - countTargetDocs, minCount..., maxCount...
    - countTargetNodes, minCount..., maxCount...
    
    Note that the non-link-related cardinality constraints of the <targetSize> element (e.g. @count, 
    @minCount, @maxCount) refer to the number of target resources found, not to the number of links 
    attempted to resolve, which may be higher. Use @resolvable to ensure all links could be resolved.
